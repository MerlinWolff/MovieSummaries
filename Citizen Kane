Citizen Kane chronicles the life of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane, one of the richest men in America. 
Beginning with his poor childhood, the film traces his rise to success and his series of failed relationships; upon Kane's death, his lavish mansion is gone through and it is concluded that he had everything a man could possibly want, yet he was still unhappy. 
This movie, often called the greatest film of all time, explores the themes of greed, isolation, and the hollowness of ambition.
